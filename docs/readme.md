## Raison d'être: What Chief Science Advisor of Canada said about COVID-19 vaccines.

On March 31, 2021, just before COVID-19 vaccination of general public  commenced, the **Chief Science Advisor of Canada** in the ["*Scientific Considerations for Using COVID-19 Vaccination Certificates"*](https://science.gc.ca/eic/site/063.nsf/eng/h_98229.html) report has  expressed several concerns and recommendations related to the uncertanties associated with using new COVID-19 vaccines that were approved under Emergercy Act and did not go through all normally conducted testing stages. Some of these are listed below:

- Scientific uncertainties: *<u>Given the short time since the COVID-19 vaccines have become available, it is not surprising that many scientific uncertainties persist</u> and are the subject of intense ongoing studies*.
- Ethical and Social Considerations: *It should also be noted that while the anticipation of more freedom may be an incentive for some to get vaccinated, <u>vaccine acceptance could decrease in others if there was a sense of coercion tied to using vaccination certificates.</u>*
- Legal Considerations: *The processes by which vaccine certificates are issued and controlled <u>need to be fraud proof</u>*
- Conclusion: *\[All levels of government could work to develop a framework that\] Maximizes <u>consistent post-vaccine monitoring</u>*

Another report was issued by the Chief Science Advisor Office on July 16, 2021, just as the vaccination rates started to pick up (but still being low - less than 10%): ["*COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis/pericarditis"*](https://science.gc.ca/eic/site/063.nsf/eng/h_98291.html), which -- in the light of the COVID-19 vaccine side effects that were just uncovered -- further emphasized the following:

- Priority actions moving forward: *<u>The emerging issue of vaccine associated heart disease requires attention</u> on two important levels:
    <u>addressing data and knowledge gaps</u> on the one hand, and <u>promoting awareness</u> and clinical care on the other.*

It could have been expected that there would be more reports produced from the Chief Science Advisor Office after July 2021 - to follow up on their  recommendations of "addressing data and knowledge gaps" and "promoting awareness", especially as most  data (such as 'Cases following vaccination' statistics) have become availalable <u>only after</u> July 2021,
and yet there were none produced still, as of February 2022.

This portal is created to address this gap -- to provide Canadians with the up to date information related to Vaccine safety and efficacy --
as directly observed form official public Government of Canada data, most of which has become available after July 2021 -- inline with the considerations by Chief Science Advisor of Canada  listed above and the [Scientific Integrity Policy](https://science.gc.ca/eic/site/063.nsf/eng/h_97643.html) principles that they have developed.

## Key Observations

Last updated: 16 February 2022
<!-- 
<p><small><a href="https://ivi-m.github.io/vitals/#ChiefSciCan">Recommendations of the&nbsp;Chief Science Advisor of Canada</a>, who advised in early stages of vaccination against coersion and being vigilant towards addressing knowledge gaps&nbsp;<u>were not</u> followed.&nbsp;The data related to &quot;knowledge gaps&quot;, such as empirically observed vaccine efficacy and safety statistics, <u>have&nbsp;become available only after August 2021</u>, however&nbsp;the latest report produced by&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://ivi-m.github.io/vitals/#ChiefSciCan">Chief Science Advisor of Canada</a>&nbsp;was published prior to that.</small></p>

<p><small><u>The new&nbsp;data collected from August 2021 invalidated&nbsp;</u>many&nbsp;originally made statements about the C19 vaccine safety and efficacy. These are listed below,&nbsp;&nbsp;also documented in many other peer-reviewed and official sources.</small></p>

1- Vaccinated get infected and transmit infection <u>not less</u>&nbsp; (possibly more) than unvaccinated.

2- Majority of vaccinated <u>are not</u> significantly protected from severe outcomes.

3- Vast majority of people infected by C19, will not have serious effects from C19, and will thus have natural immunity.

4- Natural immunity is&nbsp;better and safer than&nbsp;vaccine-induced immunity. 

5- The number of severe (life-threatening)&nbsp;vaccine reactions for children&nbsp;&nbsp;reported to date has already exceeded&nbsp; the&nbsp;number of&nbsp;children deaths from C15, and&nbsp; continues to grow as more reports are coming.

Instead of admitting the new evidence and allowing wider scrutiny and revision of originally made statements and policies,&nbsp;the Government of Canada has&nbsp;refused&nbsp;the&nbsp;invitation from&nbsp;heaths experts to discuss the new evidence (see&nbsp;<a href="http://github.com/IVI-M/vitals/blob/main/docs/medical/invite-TAM.pdf">invitation letter to Chief Public Health Officer</a>)&nbsp; and appears to be&nbsp; working towards developing new Bills that will make it even harder for Canadians to express their concerns in relationship to the&nbsp; actual COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and safety, and that will&nbsp;discriminate unvaccinated even further.

-->

- Open Canada data that has become available *after* July 2021 <u>do not appear to support </u>  the COVID-19  vaccine manufacturers\' original claims about  vaccine efficacy and safety (See images below). Specifically:

    - The number of reported serious adverse events from COVID-19 vaccine (including deaths and key organs failures)   appears to be the same order of magnitude as the number of COVID-19 deaths alone, and for certain populations higher than that. It is also noted that these numbers are reported with several months delay and may not represent the true number of side-events, as reporting of vaccines side-events is not mandatory and 

    - The risk of COVID deaths for population younger than 65 and with no other health issues is about two orders of magnitude less than for older populations with pre-existing heath issues.  Additionally, natural immunity is confirmed to reduce the risk of hospitalizations more than vaccine-induced immunity.
    
    - Certain reports produced by the Government of Canada (PHAC 'Cases following vaccination' reports) appear to contain algorithmic bias that skews   the results significantly (by order of magnitude) in favour of Fully vaccinated.  The skew was most noticeable at early stages of reporting 'Cases by Vaccination Status' statistics (July - September), when instead of the observed  10%-30% cases/deaths among Fully vaccinated, PHAC reported only 1%-3% of them.
  <!--   - When recomputed without this  bias,  the reported data  <u>do not appear to support</u> the claims made in those reports that *“Fully vaccinated individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 were significantly protected from severe outcomes.”*. The data show  that the percentage of severe outcomes (deaths and hostitlizations) of fully vaccinated is comparable to that of unvaccinated.  More detailed analysis, which is would compare the rate of the increase of severe outcomes among fully vaccinated to the national vaccination rate increase, is required. -->

NB: The statistics above is quoted directly from the source, where it was computed using  death data *since December 2020*, when there were no fully vaccinated Canadians yet (more exactly: there were 0 fully-vaccinated in December, < 1% for most of January,  <3%  until May). This is known as *algorithmic bias*, which skews results favourably towards fully-vaccinated cases. This bias can be removed using the technique described in [this paper](https://ivi-m.github.io/vitals/comment2.pdf). 
The unbiased statistics are shown below.

- The total number of deaths in last two years is comparable to (and in some provinces lower  than) their five-year average
- At the start of pandemic, when policies among the provinces varied, there was practically no “first wave” observed in Western provinces
- Since the start of pandemic, the number of all non-COVID deaths started to decline
- Sharp increase in the number of unexplained deaths  since May 2021
- Significant increased delay in reporting death causes is observed.

<!-- 
Multiple insights and anomalies (possibly, “new normals”) are observed:
- the total number of deaths over the entire period is comparable to (and in some provinces lower  than) five-year average;
- rather small number of COVID deaths – compared to the very large (x1000) number of COVID cases that have been reported,
- there was practically no “first wave” in Alberta and British Columbia at the start of pandemic);
- decrease in all non-covid causes, since the start of the pandemic (even those that have a trend to increase over time)
- sharp increase in the number of unexplained deaths, since April (which is when the vaccination was extended to general public), and finally,
- increased delay in reporting deaths: from 2 months to 3 and in some provinces to 6 months

- COVID vaccine reduces the risk of hospitalization considerably (by x10-x20)
- Natural immunity  reduces the risk of hospitalization even more (by x20-x50)  
- COVID vaccine with Natural immunity does not reduce the risk of hospitalization, possibly slightly increases it.
